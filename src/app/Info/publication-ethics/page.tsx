          Reviewers evaluate manuscripts based on content without regard to ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, citizenship, religious belief or political philosophy of the authors. They should have no conflict of interest with respect to the research, the authors and/or the research funders. Their judgments should be objective.
          <div className="br" /> <div className="br" />
          Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by the authors. They must ensure that all the information related to submitted manuscripts is kept as confidential and must report to the Editor-in-Chief if they are aware of copyright infringement and plagiarism on the author's side.
          <div className="br" /> <div className="br" />
          A reviewer who feels unqualified to review the topic of a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should notify the Editor-in-Chief and excuse himself from the review process.
